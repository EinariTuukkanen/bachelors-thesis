\begin{abstractpage}[english]
  Your abstract in English. Keep the abstract short. The abstract explains your
  research topic, the methods you have used, and the results you obtained.  
  
  The abstract text of this thesis is written on the readable abstract page as
  well as into the pdf file's metadata via the $\backslash$thesisabstract macro
  (see above). Write here the text that goes onto the readable abstract page.
  You can have special characters, linebreaks, and paragraphs here. Otherwise,
  this abstract text must be identical to the metadata abstract text.
  
  If your abstract does not contain special characters and it does not require
  paragraphs, you may take advantage of the abstracttext macro (see the comment
  below).
